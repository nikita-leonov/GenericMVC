# GenericMVC
A sample code on how to implement generic view controller and use it with UIStoryboardSegue. A detail explanation of solution available by the [link](http://leonov.co/2017/generic-segueable-view-controller/).

**Need contributors**:
This code potentially may grow into a framework. To do so all key controllers should be extended with `Segueable` & `MutableModelContainerProtocol`. PRs are welcomed.
